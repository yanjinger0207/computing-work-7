Mr Ong has a way of teaching; 
it's fun and full of life. 
He talks about atoms and molecules; 
although we sometimes sigh.
Not to mention kahoot;
Where he bobs to the beat of the boot;
I think the effort he puts in is tremendous;
there are no doubts asking why.
I think he is the best, 
his way of engaging us saturates our brains; 
and we wouldn't forget why.😎
